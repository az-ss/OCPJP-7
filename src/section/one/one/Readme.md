#ExerciseOne
Create a small program that defines some fields. Try creating some illegal field names and see what kind of error
the compiler produces. Use the naming rules and conventions as a guide.
There is no single correct answer here. Your results will vary depending on your code.

#ExerciseTwo
In the program you created in Exercise 1, try leaving the fields uninitialized and print out their values. Try the
same with a local variable and see what kind of compiler errors you can produce. Becoming familiar with common compiler errors will make it easier to recognize bugs in your code.
Again, there is no single correct answer for this exercise. Your results will vary depending on your code.
